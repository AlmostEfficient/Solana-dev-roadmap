# Solana-dev-roadmap
What do you NEED to learn to become a Solana developer? Here's the quick cut.

## General belief/theory/approach
I'm of the opinion that there is no a linear path to become a developer. You don't **need** to follow this step by step.

You **can** just start building something you're interested about and learn whatever you need to build it.

This roadmap is **suggestion**, skip ahead or jump around as you see fit.

### Pathways/types/roads/areas

For ease of understanding, I've split this roadmap into three types/areas. This is **not** like front-end/back-end development, it's the things you'll likely be working on.

The reasoning here is that most folks specialize by topic. If you're working on DeFi or trading front-ends, you probably don't care about NFT compression too much.

## FUNDAMENTALS
